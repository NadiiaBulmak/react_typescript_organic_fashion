## 🧠 My Tech Stack in This Project

- ⚛️ React  
- 🟦 TypeScript  
- 🌐 Context API for content storage  
- 🎨 SCSS + BEM  
- 📱 Responsive layout 

## 📌 Requirements

- ✅ Use **React** (optionally with **TypeScript**)
- ✅ Style the layout using **SCSS**, **SASS**, or **Tailwind CSS**
- ✅ Apply **BEM methodology** for CSS class naming
- ✅ Split layout into **reusable components**
- ✅ Store all content (texts, images) in a **state manager** (I used **Context API**) — no hardcoding!
- ✅ Make the layout **responsive**
- ⛔ Pixel-perfect is not required, but clean and structured code is a must
